I use SuSE 8, and couldn't find foomatic on the distribution discs, so I 
downloaded and installed from

http://www.linuxprinting.org/foomatic.html

This installed foomatic in /usr/local/share/foomatic, so I had to adjust 
the paths in copy_to_foomatic to:

rm -f /usr/local/share/foomatic/db/source/opt/epsonepl-Tonersave.xml # OLD.

cp driver/*  /usr/local/share/foomatic/db/source/driver/
cp opt/*     /usr/local/share/foomatic/db/source/opt/
cp printer/* /usr/local/share/foomatic/db/source/printer/

The foomatic-datafile calls didn't need to be changed, but for some 
reason on my system the program foomatic-datafile wasn't in the path, so 
I changed the calls to include the absolute path to the 
foomatic-datafile bin. I don't think other users will need to do this, 
however. For completeness: I used the calls for RedHat from the original 
copy_to_foomatic, but I don't think this is important, since te only 
difference seems to be the output file name.

The last thing I needed to adjust was the target directory for the ppd 
files:

cp -av Epson-EPL-*-cups.ppd.gz /usr/share/cups/model/

(I guess it would be OK and make more sense to add an "Epson" at the end 
of that path)

Then the printer showed up in Yast2. AFter that, I had some trouble with 
my parralel port, but I think this is more due to the fact I never used 
it with Linux before, and had some resource conflicts with my soundcard, 
so this won't bother other users either.

I've attached the new copy_to_foomatic file. If anyone is interedted in 
the .ppd files generated, let me know and I'll send them as well.

A warning: I only tried this on my system, so please backup anything 
before you try my changes!

Hope this helps a few people.

See you,
    Henning
