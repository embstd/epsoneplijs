For Mandrake the directory for the ppd-files is:
/usr/share/cups/model/epson/
I guess it doesn't matter but I changed the name of the files to 
epl5x00l.ppd.gz to have a more consistent look.
The foomatic directory itself is the same, but it uses foomatic 2.02.

Yes the default in cups after adding the right model manually was "letter". I 
don't know how foomatic and cups are working together, so I guess foomatic 
didn't "give" cups the right parameters during configuration.
Right now it seems the best way for Mandrake to copy the foomatic and cups 
files in the right directories and configure the printer via printerdrake. I 
can check next week on another PC if this is working. If not you probably 
have to use the cups administration tool to use the correct printerdriver.
