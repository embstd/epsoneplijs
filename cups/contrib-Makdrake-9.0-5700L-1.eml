Hi,

I solved the problem with cups and the options. It seems as if the 
printerconfguration tool of Mandrake didn't configure cups correctly. I 
manually configured cups (after the ppds were copied into the right directory 
which is a little bit different to redhat) and chose the correct driver for 
the printer.
Now I can choose the options for tonersave, etc. with the kde-printing dialog. 
The text-output has the correct size now, too. It seems as cups didn't use 
A4. Choosing the resolution seems to work, too.

Cheers,
Christian
